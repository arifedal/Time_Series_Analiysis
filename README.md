  # Project Overview
  The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for conducting time series analysis on stock market data. Here's a brief overview of what the notebook covers:

  1.Data Retrieval: Fetching historical stock data using yfinance.
  2. Data Visualization: Visualizing the stock data using various plot types:
      - Line Plot
      - Candlestick Chart
      - Bar Plot
      - Custom Date Range Plot
      - Candlestick Chart with Slider
      - Time Series with Range Slider and Selectors
      - Faceted Area Plot
      - Custom Tick Labels
      - Period-aligned Scatter Plot and Bar Chart
 
  ## Running the Notebook
  To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially. Make sure you have an active internet connection to fetch the stock data.

  ## Further Exploration
  The project uses the plotly library for data visualization, showcasing only a subset of the available plot types. Feel free to explore the [Plotly Graphing Library](https://plotly.com/python/) for more visualization options and customization features.
